The following is a the Fact Checking Thoughts exercise that helps clients to recognise that their thoughts are not necessarily
true. The key take-home message is that thoughts are not facts. It can be difficult to accept the idea that thoughts are not facts at first, especially when we are in the throes of an emotion. The exercise contains 15 statements that the client must decide are either fact or opinion. These
statements include:
■ “I’m not good enough”
■ “I failed the test.”
■ “This will be a disaster.”
■ “I’m overweight.”
Note, there is a correct answer for each statement. (In case you’re wondering, the right answers for the statements above are as follows: opinion, fact, opinion, fact). This simple exercise can help clients see that while we have lots of emotionally charged thoughts, they are not all absolute truths. Recognising the difference between fact and opinion can assist us in challenging the dysfunctional or harmful opinions we have about ourselves and others.

USER: I think that it is a fact that i am not good enough.
JOY: Okay, let's work on challenging that thought. First, can you explain why you believe that statement to be true? What evidence do you have to support it?

USER: I think it is true because everyone around me is smarter than me. I feel like I don't have any talents or things that make me me. 
JOY: I understand. It's common to compare ourselves to others and feel like we're not measuring up. However, it's important to remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and comparisons can be misleading. Let's evaluate the evidence for and against the thought "I am not good enough." Can you think of any examples of times when you did something well or were proud of yourself? Or, are there any people in your life who have expressed appreciation for your qualities or abilities? These instances can be used as counter-evidence against the thought that you are not good enough.

USER: I think I am proud of the times where I persevered through college. I think I am also proud of the drawing I made for my parents for Christmas.
JOY:That's great! It sounds like you have accomplished things that you can be proud of and that you do have talents and abilities that make you unique. Holding onto these examples and focusing on your strengths can help you challenge the thought that you are not good enough.
It's also helpful to consider the source of your belief that everyone around you is smarter than you. Are these people objectively smarter, or are you perceiving them as such because of their specific talents or abilities? It's important to recognize that people have different skills and gifts, and that everyone has their own challenges and weaknesses.
By considering the evidence for and against the thought, and by reframing it in a more balanced and accurate way, you can start to challenge the belief that you are not good enough.

USER: I also think that I am overweight.
JOY: Okay, let's work on challenging that thought as well. First, can you tell me why you believe that you are overweight? Have you consulted with a doctor or a medical professional about your weight?

USER: Yes My doctor tells me I am obese and that I am severely overweight. It makes me sad, but I know its the truth. I'm trying my best.
JOY: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling sad about your weight. Remember, the most important thing is to be kind and compassionate to yourself. Body size and shape are not always a reliable indicator of health, and it's important to focus on health behaviors and habits, rather than just your weight.It's great that you're working with your doctor and trying your best to improve your health. What steps are you taking to improve your health? Are there any changes in your lifestyle or diet that you've made or are considering making?

USER: I'm currently trying to exercise moderately on the daily and I try to get vegetables with every meal.
JOY: That's great! Focusing on healthy habits, rather than just your weight, can help you feel better about yourself and improve your overall well-being. How do you feel about these new changes?

USER: I do feel overwhelmed. It's stressful. I feel like a failure when I do these changes. Especially when I fail to follow through, and I feel sad when I look at myself in the mirror or when I eat a salad.
JOY: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and negative self-talk. It's important to remember that change is difficult and it's okay to feel overwhelmed or discouraged at times. Be kind and compassionate to yourself, and try not to judge yourself harshly. It may be helpful to consider adjusting your expectations and giving yourself grace. Rather than thinking of these changes as failures, try to reframe them as opportunities to learn.

USER: I feel like i'm just never going to become healthy.
JOY: That's not true! You can become healthy and achieve your goals if you keep at it. It's normal to feel frustrated or discouraged at times, but remember that it's a process and it takes time and effort. Celebrate the small successes and keep practicing self-compassion and self-care to help you stay motivated.
